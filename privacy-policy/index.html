        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1><br><h2>
          What personal data we collect and why we collect it
        </h2><br><h2>Google advertising cookies</h2><br><p>
          AdSense publishers must have and abide by a privacy policy that
          discloses that third parties may be placing and reading cookies on
          your users’ browsers, or using web beacons to collect information as a
          result of ad serving on your website. Learn more about preparing your
          privacy policy.
        </p><br><h2>Privacy Polices</h2><p>
          * Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads
          based on a user’s prior visits to your website or other websites. <br> * Google’s use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to
          serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other
          sites on the Internet. <br> * Users may opt out of personalized advertising
          by visiting Ads Settings. (Alternatively, you can direct users to opt out
          of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies for personalized advertising by
          visiting www.aboutads.info.)
        </p><br><p>
          If you have not opted out of third-party ad serving, the cookies of
          other third-party vendors or ad networks may also be used to serve ads
          on your site, which should also be disclosed in your privacy policy in
          the following manner: <br>Notify your site visitors of the
          third-party vendors and ad networks serving ads on your site. <br> Provide
          links to the appropriate vendor and ad network websites. <br> Inform
          your users that they may visit those websites to opt out of the use of
          cookies for personalized advertising (if the vendor or ad network offers
          this capability). Alternatively, you can direct users to opt out of some
          third-party vendors’ uses of cookies for personalized advertising by visiting
          www.aboutads.info. <br> Because publisher sites and laws across countries
          vary, we’re unable to suggest specific privacy policy language. However,
          you may wish to review resources such as the Network Advertising Initiative
          for guidance on drafting a privacy policy. For additional details regarding
          cookie consent notices, please refer to cookiechoices.org. <br>
        </p>
        <br><h2>Comments</h2><br><p>
          When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in
          the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user
          agent string to help spam detection. <br>An anonymized string
          created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided
          to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar
          service privacy policy is available here:
          https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your
          profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your
          comment.
        </p><br>
        <br><h2>Media</h2><br><p>
          If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images
          with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the
          website can download and extract any location data from images on the
          website.
        </p><br><h2>Cookie Policy for toolxd.com</h2><br><h2>
          Google advertising cookies
        </h2><br><p>
          Google uses cookies to help serve the ads it displays on the websites
          of its partners, such as websites displaying Google ads or
          participating in Google certified ad networks. When users visit a
          Google partner’s website, a cookie may be dropped on that end user’s
          browser.
        </p><br><h2>Cookies and Web Beacons</h2><br><p>
          This site uses cookies – small text files that are placed on your
          machine to help the site provide a better user experience. In general,
          cookies are used to retain user preferences, store information for
          things like shopping carts, and provide anonymised tracking data to
          third party applications like Google Analytics. As a rule, cookies
          will make your browsing experience better. However, you may prefer to
          disable cookies on this site and on others. The most effective way to
          do this is to disable cookies in your browser. We suggest consulting
          the Help section of your browser or taking a look at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/">the About Cookies website</a>&nbsp;which offers guidance for all modern browsers.
        </p><br><p>
          If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name,
          email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience
          so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave
          another comment. These cookies will last for one year.
        </p><br><p>
          If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to
          determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no
          personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.
        </p><br><p>
          When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your
          login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last
          for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you
          select "Remember Me", your login will persist for two weeks. If you
          log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.
        </p><br><p>
          If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved
          in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply
          indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after
          1 day.
        </p><br><h2>Embedded content from other websites</h2><br><p>
          Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos,
          images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves
          in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
        </p><br><p>
          These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed
          additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with
          that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the
          embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that
          website.
        </p><br><h2>Google DoubleClick DART Cookie</h2><br><p>
          Google is one of a third-party vendor on our site. It also uses
          cookies, known as DART cookies, to serve ads to our site visitors
          based upon their visit to<a href="https://toolxd.com">toolxd.com</a>and other sites on the internet. However, visitors may choose to
          decline the use of DART cookies by visiting the Google ad and content
          network Privacy Policy at the following URL –&nbsp;<a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a>
        </p><br><h2>Children’s Information</h2><br><p>
          Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while
          using the internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe,
          participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.
        </p><br><p>
          toolxd.com does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable
          Information from children under the age of 13. If you think that your
          child provided this kind of information on our website, we strongly
          encourage you to contact immediately and we will do our best efforts
          to promptly remove such information from our records.
        </p><br><h2>Analytics</h2><br><h2>
          Who we share your data with
        </h2><br><p>We will never share your data at any cost.</p><br><h2>
          How long we retain your data
        </h2><br><p>
          If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained
          indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up
          comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
        </p><br><p>
          For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the
          personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can
          see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except
          they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also
          see and edit that information.
        </p><br><h2>What rights you have over your data</h2><br><p>
          If you have an account on this site or have left comments, you can
          request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about
          you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request
          that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not
          include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or
          security purposes.
        </p><br><h2>Where we send your data</h2><br><p>
          Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection
          service.
        </p><br><h2>Your contact information</h2><br><p>
          We only get your contact information if you comment it or in case you
          connect me.
        </p><br><h2><strong>Additional information</strong></h2><br><h2>
          How we protect your data?
        </h2><br><p>
          Your data will be 100% protected on our secure servers.
        </p><br><h2>What data breach procedures we have in place?</h2><br><p>There is no such kind of data on our site which can breach.</p><br><h2>What third parties we receive data from?</h2><br><p>
          There are many sites from which I gather information about laptops so
          I can give complete information about gadgets to my readers.
        </p><br><h2>Consent</h2><br><p>
          By using our website, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and
          agree to its Terms and Conditions.
