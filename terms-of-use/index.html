        Company respects the intellectual property of others and asks that users

        adopted and implemented a policy respecting copyright law that provides
        for the removal of any infringing materials and for the termination of
        users of our online Site who are repeated infringers of intellectual
        property rights, including copyrights.&nbsp; If you believe that one of
        our users is, through the use of our Site, unlawfully infringing the
        copyright(s) in a work, and wish to have the allegedly infringing
        material removed, the following information in the form of a written
        notification (pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)) must be provided to our
        Designated Copyright Agent:
      </p><br><ul>
        <li>your physical or electronic signature;</li><li>
          identification of the copyrighted work(s) that you claim to have been
          infringed;
        </li><li>
          identification of the material on our services that you claim is
          infringing and that you request us to remove;
        </li><li>
          sufficient information to permit us to locate such material;
        </li><li>your address, telephone number, and e-mail address;</li><li>
          a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the
          objectionable material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its
          agent, or under the law; and
        </li><li>
          a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and
          under penalty of perjury, that you are either the owner of the
          copyright that has allegedly been infringed or that you are authorized
          to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
        </li>
      </ul><br><p>
        Please note that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), any misrepresentation
        of material fact in a written notification automatically subjects the
        complaining party to liability for any damages, costs and attorney’s
        fees incurred by us in connection with the written notification and
        allegation of copyright infringement.

        either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other
        party a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the
        claim or dispute and the requested relief.&nbsp; A Notice to the Company
        should be sent to <strong>contact@toolxd.com.</strong> After the Notice is
        received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute
        informally.&nbsp; If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute
        within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin
        an arbitration proceeding.&nbsp; The amount of any settlement offer made
        by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator
        has determined the amount of the award to which either party is entitled.
      </p><br><p>
        <strong>Arbitration Rules.</strong> The arbitration shall be initiated through
        the American Arbitration Association, an established alternative dispute
        resolution provider that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.&nbsp;
        If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an
        alternative ADR Provider.&nbsp; The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern
        all aspects of the arbitration except to the extent such rules are in conflict
        with the Terms.&nbsp; The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration
        are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.&nbsp;
        The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.&nbsp;
        Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less
        than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding
        non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.&nbsp;
        For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten
        Thousand U.S. Dollars (the US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing
        will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.&nbsp; Any hearing will be held
        in a location within 100 miles of your residence unless you reside outside
        of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise.&nbsp; If you
        reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable
        notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on
        the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
        jurisdiction.&nbsp; If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater
        than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the
        initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award
        or $2,500.00.&nbsp; Each party shall bear its own costs and disbursements
        arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and
        costs of the ADR Provider.
      </p><br><p>
        <strong>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.</strong> If
        non-appearance-based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted
        by telephone, online, and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific
        manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.&nbsp; The
        arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses
        unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
      </p><br><p>
        <strong>Time Limits.</strong> If you or the Company pursues arbitration,
        the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute
        of limitations and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the
        pertinent claim.
      </p><br><p>
        <strong>Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> If arbitration is initiated, the
        arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities of you and the Company,
        and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined
        with any other cases or parties.&nbsp; The arbitrator shall have the authority
        to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.&nbsp; The arbitrator
        shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary
        remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA
        Rules, and the Terms.&nbsp; The arbitrator shall issue a written award and
        statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on
        which the award is based.&nbsp; The arbitrator has the same authority to
        award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would
        have.&nbsp; The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and
        the Company.
      </p><br><p>
        <strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL
        AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE
        OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved
        by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp; Arbitration procedures
        are typically more limited, more efficient and less expensive than rules
        applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court.&nbsp;
        In the event, any litigation should arise between you and the Company in
        any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration
        award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY waives ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL,
        instead electing that the dispute is resolved by a judge.
      </p><br><p>
        <strong>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</strong> All claims and
        disputes within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated
        or litigated on an individual basis and not on a class basis, and claims
        of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly
        or consolidated with those of any other customer or user.
      </p><br><p>
        <strong>Confidentiality.</strong> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding
        shall be strictly confidential.&nbsp; The parties agree to maintain confidentiality
        unless otherwise required by law.&nbsp; This paragraph shall not prevent
        a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce
        this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or
        equitable relief.
